"""
Tessera Contract Schema

The contract is the machine-readable agreement between a website owner and AI agents.
It defines what agents can do, what they cannot do, rate limits, data handling terms,
and identification requirements.

The contract is presented to the agent BEFORE any interaction begins.
The agent's planning layer reads the contract and prunes its action space accordingly —
prohibited actions literally don't exist in the agent's environment.
