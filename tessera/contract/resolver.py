"""
Tessera Permission Resolver

Takes a contract and an agent profile, and computes the effective permissions
for that agent session. This is the core governance logic.

The key rule:
  - anonymous: can only read (search, view)
  - identified: can interact (add to cart, modify cart) but transactions need confirmation
  - verified: can transact with limits
  - super_agent: can transact autonomously, no confirmation needed
